# DIY

in this page you can see the process of the project how we managed to let it work and test it at ritmica and heder. Also you can see how i managed to let a sound play when you press the sensor and also how i made the pcb and why it didnt work at the end. 

### Step1: testing the leds

When we decided after the brainstorm what the prototype would do or sound i needed to test first the LED since it was a long time ago i worked with LED. Here you can see how i control the led strip y using the FastLED library.

### Step2: testing the capacitive sensor
### Step3: testing the midi
### Step4: testing everything
### step5: building the project
#### Step5.0.1: cutting the board
